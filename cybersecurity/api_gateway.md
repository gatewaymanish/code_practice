An API Gateway is a crucial component in modern system design, especially for microservices architectures. It acts as a reverse proxy that manages and routes requests from clients to backend services while handling security, authentication, and traffic control.
Key Features of an API Gateway
- Request Routing – Directs incoming API requests to the appropriate backend service.
- Authentication & Authorization – Supports OAuth, JWT, and API key-based authentication.
- Rate Limiting & Throttling – Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per second.
- Logging & Monitoring – Tracks API usage and detects anomalies.
- Request Transformation – Converts request formats (e.g., JSON to XML).
- Caching – Improves performance by storing frequently accessed responses.
- Security Enforcement – Protects against DDoS attacks, SQL injection, and other threats.
