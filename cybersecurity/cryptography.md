# Cryptography 
It is the practice of securing information by converting it into an unreadable format, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. It plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
Types of Cryptography
- Symmetric Key Cryptography â€“ Uses the same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES).
- Asymmetric Key Cryptography â€“ Uses a public-private key pair (e.g., RSA, ECC).
- Hash Functions â€“ Converts data into a fixed-length hash, ensuring integrity (e.g., SHA-256, MD5).

Applications of Cryptography
- Data Encryption â€“ Protects sensitive information in transit and at rest.
- Digital Signatures â€“ Ensures authenticity and prevents tampering.
- Secure Communications â€“ Used in VPNs, HTTPS, and messaging apps.
- Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies â€“ Ensures secure transactions.


# Cryptographic keys 
Keys are essential for securing digital communications, encrypting data, and verifying identities. They come in different types, each serving a unique purpose in cryptography.
Types of Cryptographic Keys
- Public Key â€“ Used in asymmetric encryption; shared openly to encrypt data.
- Private Key â€“ Kept secret; used to decrypt data encrypted with the public key.
- Symmetric Key â€“ Same key is used for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
- Session Key â€“ Temporary key used for a single communication session.
- Hash Keys â€“ Used in hashing algorithms to ensure data integrity.

Applications of Crypto Keys
- Data Encryption â€“ Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- Digital Signatures â€“ Ensures authenticity and prevents tampering.
- Secure Transactions â€“ Used in blockchain and cryptocurrency wallets.
- SSL/TLS Certificates â€“ Encrypts web traffic for secure browsing.
