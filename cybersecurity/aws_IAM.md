AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. It enables you to manage users, roles, and permissions to ensure that only authorized entities can interact with your AWS environment.
# Key Features of AWS IAM
- User & Role Management – Create IAM users and roles with specific permissions.
- Access Policies – Define fine-grained access control using JSON-based policies.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – Enhance security by requiring additional authentication.
- Temporary Security Credentials – Use IAM roles to grant temporary access to AWS services.
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) – Assign permissions based on user attributes.
- IAM Access Analyzer – Identify overly permissive access policies.
- AWS Organizations Integration – Manage IAM policies across multiple AWS accounts.

# Best Practices for AWS IAM Security
- Follow least privilege principles—grant only the necessary permissions.
- Enable MFA for all users, especially root accounts.
- Regularly audit IAM policies to remove unused permissions.
- Use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys.
- Monitor IAM activity using AWS CloudTrail logs.
