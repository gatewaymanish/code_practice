Data engineering security focuses on protecting data pipelines, storage, and processing systems from cyber threats. Here are key security considerations:
1. Data Access Control
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict permissions.
- Use IAM policies to enforce least privilege access.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive operations.
2. Data Encryption
- Encrypt data in transit using TLS (HTTPS).
- Encrypt data at rest with AES-256.
- Use key management services (KMS) for secure encryption key handling.
3. Secure Data Pipelines
- Validate and sanitize incoming data to prevent injection attacks.
- Use secure APIs with authentication tokens.
- Implement logging and monitoring for anomaly detection.
4. Data Integrity & Governance
- Maintain audit logs for tracking changes.
- Use checksum validation to detect data corruption.
- Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, or other regulations.
5. Threat Detection & Monitoring
- Deploy SIEM tools for real-time security monitoring.
- Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect unauthorized access.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns
