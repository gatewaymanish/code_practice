API security is crucial for protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access. Here are key aspects to consider:

1. Authentication & Authorization
- Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens for secure authentication.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict permissions.
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical endpoints.
2. Data Protection
- Encrypt data in transit using TLS (HTTPS).
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest with AES-256.
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses.
3. Rate Limiting & Throttling
- Prevent abuse by limiting API requests per user/IP.
- Use API gateways to enforce rate limits.
4. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks by validating user input.
- Use allowlists instead of blocklists for input filtering.
5. Secure API Endpoints
- Implement CORS policies to control cross-origin requests.
- Restrict access to internal APIs using private networks.
6. Logging & Monitoring
- Enable audit logs for API activity tracking.
- Use SIEM tools to detect anomalies and security threats.
7. API Gateway & Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Deploy an API gateway for centralized security management.
- Use WAF to block malicious traffic.
