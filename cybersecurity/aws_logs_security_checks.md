- Helps detect unauthorized modifications and compliance violations.
3. Amazon CloudWatch Logs
- Collects logs from applications, services, and infrastructure.
- Enables real-time monitoring and alerting for anomalies.
4. AWS GuardDuty Findings
- Uses machine learning to detect threats like unusual API calls, compromised credentials, and malware activity.
5. AWS Security Hub
- Aggregates security findings from multiple AWS services.
- Provides compliance checks and security best practices.
6. VPC Flow Logs
- Captures network traffic metadata for security analysis.
