When analyzing logs for security, it's crucial to check for key parameters that help detect threats, ensure compliance, and maintain system integrity. Here are some important security aspects to monitor:
1. Authentication & Access Control
- Failed login attempts (potential brute-force attacks)
- Successful logins (especially from unusual locations)
- Privilege escalations (unexpected admin access)
- Account lockouts (indicating repeated failed attempts)
2. Network & System Activity
- Unusual outbound connections (possible data exfiltration)
- Unexpected inbound traffic (potential intrusion attempts)
- Changes to firewall rules (unauthorized modifications)
- High CPU/memory usage spikes (signs of malware or DDoS attacks)
3. File & Data Integrity
- Unauthorized file modifications (possible tampering)
- Access to sensitive files (especially outside business hours)
- Unexpected database queries (potential SQL injection attempts)
- Large data transfers (possible data leaks)
4. Application & System Errors
- Frequent application crashes (could indicate exploitation)
- Unexpected system reboots (possible malware activity)
- Changes to system configurations (unauthorized modifications)
- Failed security updates (leaving vulnerabilities open)
5. Security Tools & Alerts
- Disabled antivirus or security tools (potential compromise)
- Unusual activity in SIEM logs (security information and event management)
- Changes to logging settings (attempts to cover tracks)
- Unauthorized API calls (possible exploitation)
